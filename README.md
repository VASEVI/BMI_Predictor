# Weight Predict & Management — Demo Project


## Overview
A small project that trains a Decision Tree Classifier to classify a person's BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) using features like age, gender, diet, exercise minutes, smoking and drinking habits. A Flask web UI collects inputs, calls the model, and shows a prediction plus tailored recommendations.


## Setup
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):


```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
